Create a basic webpage that will include one of the number images from the course resources.  JavaScript is to be embedded into your HTML document.

Use JavaScript to trigger an alert box when the page is fully loaded into the browser. The alert box should say “Lesson #1 is Done”.

When the number image in the document is clicked with the mouse, the image should change to a different number and an alert box should say “Image Updated.”
